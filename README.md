# SQL Project Week 2

In this project, I extract some data from the DVD rental database (https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/postgresql-getting-started/postgresql-sample-database/) and try to analyze the DVD rental performance from various aspects. It covers 15 tables, including: 

1. actor – stores actors' data including first name and last name.
2. film – stores film data such as title, release year, length, rating, etc.
3. film_actor – stores the relationships between films and actors.
4. category – stores film’s categories data.
5. film_category- stores the relationships between films and categories.
6. store – contains the store data including manager staff and address.
7. inventory – stores inventory data.
8. rental – stores rental data.
9. payment – stores customer’s payments.
10. staff – stores staff data.
11. customer – stores customer data.
12. address – stores address data for staff and customers
13. city – stores city names.
14. country – stores country names.
15. language - stores the language data.
